# Ferry Loading

The solutions I have created for the ferry loading problem by online judge. One solution uses an array to solve the problem and the other solution uses a hash table.
With the array I was able to achieve a best time of 0.200s. With the hash table implmentation the best time achieved was 0.090s. All times were measured and confirmed by onlinejudge.org.
